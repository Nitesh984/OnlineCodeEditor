# OnlineCodeEditor

This online code editor provides a user-friendly platform for developers to write and test their code. With the integration of Judge0 API, it can compile multiple programming languages, including but not limited to C++, Python, and Java. This editor also features a syntax highlighting function that makes it easier for developers to identify errors in their code.
## Using Rapid API and Judge0 
- I have used RapidAPI and JUDGE0 for compiling the codes.
